# MGT6203Project

Inflation data investigation seeking to answer two primary questions:
1. Are current inflation levels unprecedented and what are the driving factors causing current inflation levels? 
2. What are some common goods whose price changes are above, below, or at the inflation rate? 
    - We may look at individual products such as McDonaldâ€™s hamburgers, Ford Cars, etc. 
    - We may use more aggregated data based on industries, categories of good, etc.
